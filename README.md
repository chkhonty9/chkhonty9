# 👋 Hello, I’m Nouhaila Chkhonty

## 🧑‍💻 Fullstack Developer & DevOps Engineer  
**Crafting Scalable Web Applications | Automating Infrastructure | Building Intelligent Systems**

## 🧭 Who I Am

I'm a versatile software engineer passionate about delivering reliable, high-performance applications — from the first line of code to production deployment.

With a strong foundation in both **fullstack development** and **DevOps practices**, I build systems that are not only functional and user-friendly, but also automated, resilient, and cloud-ready. I’m particularly interested in **intelligent automation**, **agentic AI applications**, and **streamlining development workflows**.

I bring together the mindset of a developer and the discipline of operations to build software that just works — at scale.

## 🚀 What I Do Best

- 🔧 **Fullstack Development**: End-to-end feature delivery using modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks, REST/GraphQL APIs, and robust backend systems.  
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, orchestration, monitoring, and infrastructure as code.  
- 🧠 **AI-Augmented Systems**: Experience with integrating LLMs and building agentic applications for smart, autonomous workflows.  
- 🔁 **Workflow Automation**: Automating business processes and development tasks with tools like `n8n`, custom scripts, and cloud-native integrations.  
- 📈 **Observability & Reliability**: Logging (ELK), monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), and performance optimization.
